## PROJECT: HEXAPOD 
- I want to be a part of this project to know about the software part and also how it is connected to make the hexapod working. I am very much interested in the mechanics of the hexapod that results into such structure. I really want to work on this project so that I can get in depth knowledge about each and every step required. 

## PROJECT: BALL BALANCING BOT 
- It has always intrigued me how such a small chip like structure of raspberry pi is used in such projects of robotics. I have never run a code and seen that help into a robot balancing the ball by detecting and that is something I want to learn from this project.
